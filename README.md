# Avast <= 24.1.x Elevation of Privilege (Local Privilege Escalation) via Symbolic Link Following -> Arbitrary File Deletion

Reported to Gen (Avast) in a private bounty program, we were working closely to help remediate the vuln, even notified them about the 2nd LPE as a result from their first "fix". When fixed in v24.2, they decided to ghost the rewards and credit so exploits are now public.
